## In class exercises
### Warm Up (slide 2)
Question:  What is a card on a website?
Bonus: How many different ways can you think of to use one?


### Think Time (slide 3)
Students have a minute to look at the code block and consider what it's doing, how to modify it, and any other observations. Students should jot down thier thoughts before the time is up. 

Provided: 

```
<body>
  <!--- Header --->
  <h1>Cards in Bootstrap:</h1>

  <!--- Main Content --->
  <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;"> <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="Card image cap">

    </div>
  </div>

Students have a minute to turn and discuss with a partner what they think it will do.  One group will share out, groups that had new information or different ideas, share out for discussion and clarification. 

### Introduction to Bootstrap (slide 5)
* Demonstration on how to navigate to Bootstrap and find the component section > Card.
