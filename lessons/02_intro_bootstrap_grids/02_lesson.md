# Introduction to Grids in Bootstrap 

## Summary:
Students have completed a six week unit in basic HTML and CSS.  This lesson will build on those skills so that students can apply dynamic features to a web page prior to learning Javascript. 

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can define what a "grid" is an identify an example on the Internet.
* I can modify Bootstrap elements to create a three column row.

## In class exercises
### Warm Up (slide 2)
Question:  What are grids and why do we need them?

### Think Time (slide 3)
Students have a minute to look at the code block and consider what it's doing, how to modify it, and any other observations. Students should jot down thier thoughts before the time is up. 

Provided: 

```
<div class="container text-center">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>

  </div>
</div>
```


### Talk Time (slide 4)
Students have a minute to turn and discuss with a partner what they think it will do.  One group will share out, groups that had new information or different ideas, share out for discussion and clarification. 

### Introduction to Bootstrap (slide 6)
* Demonstration on how to navigate to Bootstrap and find the Layout section > Grid.
* Demonstration on how to browse the site without getting overwhelmed.
* How to preview each element and copy the code.
* Students are provided a basic html code block to work with:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>html_starter</title>
</head>

<body>
  <!--- Header --->

  <!--- Main Content --->

  <!--- End Main Content --->

  <!--- Footer --->

</body>

</html>
```
* Students paste the Bootstrap code into the body and make adjustments to personalize their work.

### Activities (slide 6)
* Level 1: Add a three column row, personalize the content by changing the type
* Level 2: Add another row, personalize each one, add a different color to each.
