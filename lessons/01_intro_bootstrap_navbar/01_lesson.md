# Introduction to Bootstrap "Nav" "Tab" and "Navbar"

## Summary:
Students have completed a six week unit in basic HTML and CSS.  This lesson will build on those skills so that students can apply dynamic features to a web page prior to learning Javascript. 

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can define what a "nav" or a "tab" bar is an identify an example on the Internet.
* I can modify Bootstrap elements to create a personalized navigation system.

## In class exercises
### Warm Up (slide 2)
Question:  Which site do you think uses a “nav” or a “tab”?
Bonus: Can you identify where they are?

### Introduction to Bootstrap (slide 3)
Bootstrap is 
- an HTML, CSS and JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development 
- an external style sheet that provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements

### Think Time (slide 4)
Provided: 

```
<nav class="nav">
  <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Active</a>
  <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
  <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
  <a class="nav-link disabled">Disabled</a>
</nav>
```
Students have a minute to look at the code block and consider what it's doing, how to modify it, and any other observations. Students should jot down thier thoughts before the time is up.
