## Summary: 
Once students have completed their personal portfolio websites, they will have a chance to discuss and research issues related to accessibility.  While accessibility is not a criteria of the overall unit or final assessment, it is important to empower students to recognize the importance of accessibility in their designs.  

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can define web accessibility and provide multiple examples.
* I can discuss why accessibility is important and who benefits from it. 

## Warm Up:
Write/Pair/Share

Question: What is accessibility?

Possible answers:
* having access
* assistive technology
* needing help to do things

## Hook:
* Watch: [Apple - Accessibility - Sady](https://youtu.be/XB4cjbYywqg)
* As students watch, have them jot down when they see examples of accessibility
* Share out

## Exploration:
* What is web accessibility?
* What kinds of assistive technology to people need when using the Internet
  * From [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/): 
    * auditory
    * cognitive
    * neurological
    * physical
    * speech
    * visual
* Who else benefits from accessibility?
  * From [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/):
    * people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
    * older people with changing abilities due to ageing
    * people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
    * people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
    * people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth
    * older people
    * people in rural areas
    * people in developing countries

## Definition:
* **Web accessibility** means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:
  * perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
  * contribute to the Web
    
 ## Activity:
 * In pairs, students can look over the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) to make observations.
 * Then, take turns testing each other's sites out to see their scores:
   * Automated accessibility checkers:
      * https://accessibilitytest.org/
      * https://www.webaccessibility.com/
 * Students can try to reference what may have caused issues on their sites.
 * Record scores on the board to see who site is the highest/lowest
 
 
## Reflection:
* Watch  [The Greatest](https://youtu.be/8sX9IEHWRJ8), by Apple
* Have students write one powerful word on a sticky note that they notice during the video.
* Stick them on the board/hang them in the classroom as a reminder.
