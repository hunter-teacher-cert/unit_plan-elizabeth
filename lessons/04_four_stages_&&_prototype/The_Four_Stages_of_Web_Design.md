# Title: 
The Four Stages of Web Design

# Summary:
Students are familiar with the design process and have used it throughout the course to plan and implement design work.  This foundation will dovetail with the introduction of the four stages of web design introduced in this lesson.  Students will learn new ways of planning with paper prototypes and wireframes. 

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can define the four stages of web design and describe how each stage applies to web design.
* I can use stages 1 and 2 to develop a paper prototype and wireframe for a personal web portfolio.
