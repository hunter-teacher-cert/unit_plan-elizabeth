# Title: 
The Four Stages of Web Design

# Summary:
Students are familiar with the design process and have used it throughout the course to plan and implement design work.  This foundation will dovetail with the introduction of the four stages of web design.  Students will learn new ways of planning with paper prototypes and wireframes. 

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can define the four stages of web design and describe how each stage applies to web design.
* I can use stages 1 and 2 to develop a paper prototype and wireframe for a personal web portfolio.

## In class exercises
### Warm Up:
Students go over a review of the design process (slide 1).  
* Describe the steps and discuss how the process is not always linear
* Have students recall how the design process has been used in previous projects
### Task:
* Students work in small groups (2-3 people) to synthesize/hypothesize how the design process would fold/dovetail into four stages of web design.  They will make predictions.
* Students will use sticky notes to develop what they think
