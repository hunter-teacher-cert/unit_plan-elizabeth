# Design Challenge - Bootstrap Jigsaw

## Summary:
Students have completed a six week unit in basic HTML and CSS.  They have also learned how to incorporate Bootstrap into their HTML files and apply dynamic features to a web page. This lesson empowers students to work with a small group to design a mini-project that showcases a new Bootstrap feature.

## Learning Outcomes:
* I can use the four stages of web design to develop an idea for a website.
* I can use the Bootstrap resource to learn and modify new elements.
* I can collaborate on a team to design a Dryden Highlights Magazine mini-site. 

## In class exercises
### Warm Up (slide 2)
Task:  Find a group of 2 or 3 people that you have worked with productively.  

### Introduction to Design Challenge - Bootstrap Jigsaw (slide 3)
* In small teams, students will create a mini-magazine (one page per student in the group) of Dryden High School Highlights. These can be real or imagined.
* The mini-site should include a grid, a navbar AND A NEW Bootstrap element that we have not gone over in class.
* Bootstrap considerations: CAROUSEL, ASMMETRICAL GRIDS, ASYMMETRICAL COLUMNS, CARD GROUPS AND GRID CARDS, 
* The site should be wireframed FIRST - with a paper prototype that shows:
  - each page
  - the navigation considerations
  - where elements will be placed
* The NEW BOOTSTRAP ELEMENT should be heavily commented so that others can use it as a guide.

### Provided Starter Code:

* Students are provided a basic html code block to work with:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>HTML Starter</title>
  <!---this links to the bootstrap css that controls the columns--->
  <link href="css/bootstrap-4.4.1.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>

<body>
  <!--- Header --->

  <!--- Main Content --->

  <!--- End Main Content --->

  <!--- Footer --->

</body>

</html>
```
* Students paste the Bootstrap code into the body and make adjustments to personalize their work.

### Activities:
* Step 1: Plan | Wireframe | Research Bootstrap
* Step 2: Gather Assets | Build Pages
* Step 3: Present
* Deliverables:
  * paper prototype
  * a mini-website
  * commented code on how to use a new element in Bootstrap
