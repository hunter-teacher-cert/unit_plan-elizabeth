# UNIT PLAN: Art Portfolio using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
by ELIZABETH RECHTIN

-----

### General Overview
The unit is a Professional Web-Based Art Portfolio using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS Snippets.  This unit is at the end of a full year Graphic Design course in which the second half of the year is learning HTML and CSS, and is designed as a culminating project following weeks of study.  Within this unit, students will research, plan, mock-up and create an Art Portfolio.  They will be required to use Bootstrap and JS Snippets to personalize their interface.  This course fits into a 5 unit Sequence in the Arts and is a Concurrent Enrollment course through a local community college.  Students have taken a foundation Media Arts course prior to this year, and have spent the first semester and part of the second semester working with desing concepts and software programs.

### Motivation for Unit
Over the summer I wrote a scope and sequence to introduce basic HTML and CSS to my graphic design class during the second semester.  The scope and sequence goes through various exercises to teach students the basics, then how to format pages, add links/link pages, add images, etc.  I referenced curricula such as Code.org, W3Schools, some Mouse.org and other resources.  This scope and sequence has a basic flow and progression of skills and concepts, but I haven't created any of the units or lessons within the broader plan to date.  To practice their newly acquired skills throughout each unit, students will complete various mini-projects (such as working with a notepad to test out syntax, a recipe, a story/comic, a two page magazine,  and then a fake business website to learn different skills/syntax).
The final goal is to have them design a personal art portfolio website.   Originally I was thinking that I would introduce basic JavaScript, but after discussing this with some of my colleagues, I realize that the jump to JavaScript would be too big of a leap and better left for a new course development idea.  As a result, my unit plan will continue with HTML and CSS but adding advanced concepts, as well as Bootstrap and JS Snippets for interactivity without fully introducing JavaScript.
